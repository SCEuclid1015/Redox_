        <h2>About Project</h2>
        <p>
            The Humanoid Robot project aims to create an interactive humanoid robot that can perform basic tasks and respond to voice commands. Using the ESP32-CAM microcontroller, this robot leverages advanced technologies such as computer vision and machine learning to enhance its functionality. Equipped with a built-in camera, the ESP32-CAM allows the robot to recognize objects and navigate its environment autonomously.
